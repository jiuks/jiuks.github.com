I have read a lot and tried to do a lot regarding productivity over the last few years. A couple of days ago I read [this article](http://mosx.tumblr.com/post/56776970361/find-your-life-priorities-with-omnifocus-omnigraffle) which was linked to from the [Simplicity Bliss website](http://simplicitybliss.com/).

One thing the article spoke about was prioritising your tasks and how to do that within a Getting Things Done framework or tool. I use a system in [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) where I create some high level folders to structure my projects, I have one called Immediate and one called Focus. I use these to try to provide focus to the multitude of tasks and projects I am involved in.

Today I realised that there was a potential flaw in my plan. I never scheduled any time to do any of these. Like most other people in management positions my time got taken up by meetings, client visits, processing emails, travel and various other miscellaneous activities, however when I start to plan my week I would never block out any time to devote to them.

No great surprise I find myself processing the same projects in OmniFocus again and again. This week I am going to block out time and try and progress these, on my own terms, not caught up in meetings, not in the evenings, not at 6am in the morning, or on a flight or train.
